| Package                                  | Description                                                                                                                                                 |
| ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [`config`](./packages/config)            | Common configurations for tsconfig, tsup, biome, typedoc and tailwind                                                                                       |
| [`connect-kit`](./packages/connect-kit/) | It allows connection to multiple blockchains and wallets, manages accounts, and enables interaction with smart contracts.                                   |
| [`crypto`](./packages/crypto)            | It includes various cryptographic functions and utilities for encryption, decryption, hashing, and more.                                                    |
| [`encoding`](./packages/encoding)        | Encoding helpers that are used across packages and assist in encoding and decoding data in various formats                                                  |
| [`react`](./packages/react)              | It wrap connect-kit actions into react-hooks and wrap the state in a react provider with hydration for ssr                                                  |
| [`sdk`](./packages/sdk)                  | The SDK package provides a set of tools and utilities to interact with [Grug] execution environment                                                         |
| [`types`](./packages/types)              | It contains various type definition used across the codebase. These types help ensure type safety and improve code readbility.                              |
| [`utils`](./packages/utils)              | Its a collection of utility functions that are used across the project. These utilities are designed to simplify common tasks and improve code reusability. |
